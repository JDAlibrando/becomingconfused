				Stand beside me, <br>
				in the space that separates us, <br>
				and share the sight of this juniper tree. <br>
				<br>
				When we share this juniper <br>
				do our worlds not overlap?! <br>
				Does its unity— <br>
				the gnarled trunk and scale-like leaves, <br>
				that evades our understanding like flames through our fingers <br>
				and projects dancing shade onto all eyes in its purview— <br>
				give us a glimpse of each other? <br>
				<br>
				When we share the image of this juniper, <br>
				its storm and scales, <br>
				do we not share the moment as mirrors?! <br>
				You, me, and tree reflecting each. <br>
				A transparent flame lost in a hall of mirrors. <br>
				<br>
				It is obvious and impossible <br>
				that space is so impenetrable <br>
				but for shadows on the wall of a pinhole camera. <br>
				Doubt is persistent, but… <br>
				<br>
				If I am to peer behind my eyes <br>
				and understand this juniper as singular, <br>
				not as the multitudes of eye-cast shadows <br>
				but as the lost flame that projects becoming to them, then… <br>
				<br>
				Maybe I will again remember why <br>
				we can know the Other <br>
				as we share the sight of this juniper tree. <br>
