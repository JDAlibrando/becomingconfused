				Stand beside me, <br>
				in the space that separates us,<br>
				and share the sight of this juniper tree.<br>
				<br>
				When we share this juniper,<br>
				do our worlds not overlap?<br>
				Does its form—<br>
				the unity of the storm-blown trunk and crystal blue-green scales,<br>
				that evades our grasp as flames through our fingers,<br>
				and projects dancing shade onto all eyes in its purview<br>
				—give us a glimpse of each other?<br>
				<br>
				When we share the image<br>
				of this juniper,<br>
				its stormy trunk and crystalline scales,<br>
				do we not share the moment as mirrors?<br>
				You, me, and tree reflecting each,<br>
				as a transparent flame <br>
				in a hall of mirrors. <br>
				<br>
				If I am to peer past our multiverse,<br>
				and understand this tree as singular<br>
				not the multitudes of eye-cast storms and crystals,<br>
				but as the hidden flame that projects becoming to them.<br>
				<br>
				Then <br>
				maybe I will again remember why <br>
				we can know the Other, <br>
				as we share the sight of this juniper tree. <br>
