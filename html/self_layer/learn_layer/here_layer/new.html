				People float down the river, <br>
				familiar with the water that accompanies them. <br>
				<br>
				So do I until I brace against a stone <br>
				and feel the water push past my petite frame, <br>
				my feet tingling with the depth of the earth. <br>
				<br>
				The water that once held me, <br>
				I realize, had another agenda, <br>
				to continue down its trajectory, <br>
				as eager to leave me behind <br>
				as to insist on my return <br>
				to the rivers flow. <br>
				<br>
				So, I am left behind <br>
				by that force that once moved me <br>
				or tossed me in its turbulence. <br>
				<br>
				And, I wonder <br>
				what to do now. <br>
