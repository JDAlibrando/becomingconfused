			<p>
				Beauty has a horror, <br>
				an echoing undertone, <br>
				reverberating sympathetically by some distant clarity <br>
				that leaves tinnitus in lowly ears in odd moments. <br>
				<br>
				A message that meaning, <br>
				is a flame to a moth, <br>
				beyond the arena of this personality. <br>
				<br>
				A message that I must love  <br>
				by opening to this lowliness. <br>
				Compassion that he must only know echoes. <br>
				Sympathies resonating in what is heavy <br>
				and will only become light by flame. <br>
				<br>
				Beautyâ€™s horror is a realization. <br>
				We have forgotten again <br>
				that beauty is using us (needs us) <br>
				for her own discovery. <br>
				<br>
				And, we will forget, <br>
				under the weight of our body, <br>
				till we surrender to that heaviness <br>
				and the light in its bonds.
